# Samo Server Architecture

Samo Server is a native self-hosted listening server for music, audiobooks, podcasts, and programmed radio. It is not a wrapper around Navidrome or Audiobookshelf. The goal is to provide Samo-native concepts with enough metadata richness to support a "home Spotify" client experience, while leaving room for compatibility adapters later.

This document is a living guide for humans and AI agents building the server. Update it whenever the architecture, module boundaries, data model, scanner behavior, or API contracts meaningfully change.

## Current State

The server currently has these major pieces:

- HTTP server entrypoint in `cmd/samo-server`
- env-driven process config in `internal/config`
- SQLite open/migrate layer in `internal/storage`
- embedded SQL migrations in `migrations`
- rich catalog domain models and in-memory read service in `internal/catalog`
- SQLite catalog hydration in `internal/catalog/sqlite.go`
- metadata scanners in `internal/scanner`
- optional external metadata lookup providers in `internal/metadata`
- filesystem library watcher in `internal/watch`
- library management and scan orchestration in `internal/libraries`
- embedded cover extraction and cache in `internal/covers`
- playback state persistence in `internal/playback`
- per-user shelf bookmarks, collections, and listening sessions in `internal/shelfuser`
- local media file access and streaming in `internal/files`
- remote source ingestion in `internal/sources`
- Samo-native HTTP API handlers in `internal/api`
- Subsonic/OpenSubsonic compatibility adapter in `internal/subsonic`
- Last.fm scrobbling adapter in `internal/lastfm`
- 24/7 radio station module in `internal/radio`
- shared media taxonomy in `internal/media`

There is no GUI yet. The current UI surface is only a small root status page. The important product surface is the API.

## Foundation Work Log

Record completed foundation-layer work here so later features do not need to reopen low-level design. Each entry should name the owning package, schema changes, API contracts, and intentional limits.

### 2026-05-22 — First-run setup wizard

**Packages:** `internal/api`, `internal/users`, `cmd/samo-server`

**Behavior**

- On a fresh install the server no longer auto-generates a bootstrap admin password. The user-server row remains (so the legacy `SAMO_API_TOKEN` still maps to it), but no admin row is created until env vars opt in (`SAMO_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME` or `SAMO_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`) or the wizard completes.
- `/` redirects to `/setup` while setup is pending; `/setup` redirects back to `/` once an admin + library + scan exist.
- `users.bootstrap` defers admin creation when both username and password are blank, so headless deploys with secrets still work and humans see the wizard.

**HTTP API (`/api/v1/setup/*`)**

- `GET /api/v1/setup/status` — public; returns `{needsSetup, hasAdmin, hasLibrary, libraryCount, hasScanned, currentStep}`.
- `POST /api/v1/setup/admin` — public when no admin exists; creates the first admin and returns a login `LoginResponse` (user + bearer token). Subsequent calls return 409.
- `GET /api/v1/setup/directories?path=…` — public during setup, admin-only afterwards. Lists subdirectories under the provided absolute path with item counts. Rejects `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/run`. Empty path returns a suggested-locations list (`$HOME`, `/srv`, `/mnt`, `/media`, `/opt`, `/var/lib`, `/data`).
- `POST /api/v1/setup/libraries` — requires the admin token issued in step 1; calls `libraries.Service.Create`.
- `POST /api/v1/setup/scan` — runs `libraries.ScanAll(TriggerAPI)` and refreshes the catalog.
- `POST /api/v1/setup/complete` — no-op gate that returns done state.

**`/setup` UI**

- Single self-contained HTML page served by `setup_page.go`. Vanilla JS + CSS, no build step, no framework. Stores the admin token in `localStorage` and uses it for every subsequent setup request.
- Three steps with an inline progress indicator: admin account → library folders (with a directory browser and a free-form path field) → first scan.

**Tests**

- Full wizard flow: fresh status → admin creation → token use → library creation → status advances.
- Repeat admin creation is rejected (409).
- Library creation without the admin token is rejected (401).
- Directory browser returns suggested-locations entries for the root path and rejects system paths.
- `/setup` redirects to `/` once an admin + library + scan exist.
- Bootstrap behavior split tests: empty input defers to wizard, explicit username generates a password.

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- The wizard does not yet offer Last.fm/metadata-provider configuration screens; those are still env-var-driven.
- Library browser surfaces only direct subdirectories — no media-content sniffing or scan-preview yet.
- The wizard issues a single short-lived bearer token via the standard login flow; there is no "remember this device" or session cookie story yet.
- No "danger zone" rescue mode for re-running the wizard after corruption; admins must fix data state via the catalog API.

### 2026-05-22 — Remote cover art download

**Packages:** `internal/covers`, `internal/metadata`, `cmd/samo-server`

**`internal/covers`**

- `Service.DownloadFromURL` fetches an image URL into the cover cache and persists an `extracted_covers` row keyed by URL hash. Repeated calls with the same URL hit the existing row and skip the network.
- SSRF guard rejects empty/`localhost`/`.local`/loopback/private/link-local hosts unless `RemoteOptions.AllowPrivateHosts` is set (tests only).
- Content-Type must start with `image/`; oversized responses (default 5 MiB) and empty bodies fail with `ErrTooLarge` / `ErrUnsupportedType`.
- Cover IDs are derived from a stable hash of the normalized URL so the same artwork at the same address is content-addressable.

**`internal/metadata`**

- `CoverDownloader` interface (matched implicitly by `covers.Service`) wires the downloader into `MetadataApplyService` via `NewMetadataApplyServiceWithOptions`.
- `resolveCoverInCandidate` runs before merge for non-preview apply calls. On success the candidate's `Cover.URL` is preserved and `Cover.ID`/`Cover.Path` get the local cover values so override patches store a local-first reference instead of a remote URL.
- Failures are logged and never block the apply; the apply falls back to writing the external URL form.

**Tests**

- Download round-trips a fake JPEG, stores it, and repeated downloads reuse the cache row (one upstream hit).
- Non-image content types are rejected.
- Loopback URLs are rejected when `AllowPrivateHosts` is false.
- Oversized bodies are rejected when they exceed `MaxBytes`.

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- No HEAD-then-GET probe; the downloader streams immediately and bails on size violation.
- No retry/backoff; transient failures during apply simply log and fall back to the URL form.
- No background prefetch — covers download only at user-initiated apply time.

### 2026-05-22 — Catalog-backed radio stations

**Packages:** `internal/radio`, `internal/api`, `cmd/samo-server`, `migrations/014_radio_stations.sql`

**Database**

- New `radio_stations` table holds station-level fields: name, description, content type, epoch, enabled flag, and a `source` column (`database` for API-created rows, `file` for JSON-imported rows).
- New `radio_station_items` table holds ordered loop entries: position, source kind, source ID, fallback path, display fields, kind, duration, weight.

**`internal/radio`**

- `ImportConfigIfEmpty` seeds the DB from a JSON `Config` on first ever startup (radio_stations table empty). Once any DB row exists the JSON file is ignored.
- `LoadStationsFromDB` / `LoadStationByID` hydrate stations with resolved items.
- `resolveItem` joins music tracks, shelf items, and podcast episodes against `media_files` so playable file paths come from the catalog. Items with broken or remote-only references are marked `missing` and dropped from the runtime loop without removing the DB row.
- `NewServiceFromDB` constructor and `Service.Reload` rebuild the in-memory schedule from DB records.
- `Service.CreateStation` / `UpdateStation` / `DeleteStation` / `AddStationItem` / `RemoveStationItem` write through the DB and trigger a reload.
- Station summary now exposes `enabled` and `source` so admin UIs can distinguish API vs file-managed rows.

**HTTP API**

- `GET/POST /api/v1/radio/admin/stations` — list/create stations (admin).
- `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/radio/admin/stations/{id}` — read, patch, delete (admin).
- `POST /api/v1/radio/admin/stations/{id}/items` — append an item (admin).
- `DELETE /api/v1/radio/admin/items/{itemId}` — remove an item (admin).
- Existing public `GET /api/v1/radio/stations` routes are unchanged.

**Item source kinds**

- `path`: explicit absolute path (the legacy JSON shape).
- `music-track`: catalog music track ID; resolver picks the first linked `media_file`.
- `shelf-item`: catalog shelf item ID (audiobook or single-file).
- `shelf-episode`: catalog podcast episode ID; remote-only episodes are skipped until cached locally.

**Tests**

- `ImportConfigIfEmpty` seeds JSON stations and refuses to re-import once rows exist.
- Station + item CRUD round-trips through the DB.
- Music track resolution joins through `media_files` and pulls track/artist/album fields when not overridden.
- `NewServiceFromDB` builds a runnable in-memory station from a DB-only seed.

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- No reordering API yet; positions are append-only.
- No playlist-source kind (auto-resolves to current playlist tracks).
- No smart-query source kind (genre/recently-added/etc.).
- The radio stream module still reads file bytes directly; remote episode bytes need cache integration before they can stream from a radio station.

### 2026-05-22 — Internet radio metadata probing

**Packages:** `internal/sources`, `internal/api`, `internal/config`, `cmd/samo-server`, `migrations/013_internet_radio_probe.sql`

**Database**

- Added probe columns on `internet_radio_stations`: `now_playing`, `now_playing_artist`, `now_playing_title`, `now_playing_updated_at`, `probe_enabled`, `probe_interval_seconds`, `next_probe_at`, `last_probe_started_at`, `last_probe_finished_at`, `last_probe_error`, `consecutive_probe_errors`, `probe_status`.
- Index on `(probe_enabled, next_probe_at)` for due-station queries.

**`internal/sources`**

- `ProbeIcyStream` issues an `Icy-MetaData: 1` request, captures ICY headers (`icy-name`, `icy-genre`, `icy-br`, `icy-description`, `icy-url`, `icy-metaint`, `Content-Type`), and reads one Shoutcast metadata frame when the server advertises one. Falls back to a raw HTTP/1.0 dial for legacy Shoutcast v1 servers that respond `ICY 200 OK`.
- `parseStreamTitle` decodes `StreamTitle='Artist - Title';` payloads (single or double quoted), splits on `" - "` for the artist/title heuristic, and tolerates trailing pairs like `StreamUrl`.
- `ProbeInternetRadioStation` runs a probe, applies the result without clobbering user-set values, schedules `next_probe_at` from the station's interval, and records failures with capped backoff (60s floor, 6h ceiling).
- `RunInternetRadioProbeCycle` walks due enabled stations on each tick.
- `UpdateInternetRadioStation` patches name, description, homepage/image URLs, country, language, tags, enabled flag, and probe settings; rejects intervals outside `[60s, 24h]`.
- `ProbePoller` runs alongside the existing podcast feed poller.

**Config**

- `SAMO_INTERNET_RADIO_PROBE` (default `true`) — start the probe poller.
- `SAMO_INTERNET_RADIO_PROBE_TICK` (default `1m`) — scheduler tick interval.

**HTTP API**

- `PATCH /api/v1/internet-radio/stations/{id}` — update station + probe settings (admin).
- `POST /api/v1/internet-radio/stations/{id}/probe` — probe a single station (admin).
- `POST /api/v1/internet-radio/stations/probe` — run one cycle of due stations (admin).
- `GET` station responses include `nowPlaying` and `probe` schedule blocks.

**Tests**

- ICY response with metadata frame yields station headers, codec mapping, and parsed StreamTitle.
- Probe persists now-playing, codec, and bitrate without overwriting user-set bitrate.
- Probe failures record `consecutive_probe_errors`, `last_probe_error`, and `probe_status`.
- Update interval validation and `next_probe_at` clearing when probing is disabled.
- StreamTitle parsing across quoting styles, with/without artist, and trailing extras.

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- Probing only consumes one metadata frame per call — long-running listeners that refresh on every track change are out of scope for now.
- Probe results overwrite stale ICY-derived fields but never user-set name; future work can introduce per-field override flags similar to the metadata override layer.
- No public read endpoint streams the probed audio bytes through Samo; the public `/internet-radio/{id}/stream` route still redirects to the upstream URL.

### 2026-05-22 — Library management, scan jobs, and scanner pruning

**Packages:** `internal/libraries`, `internal/scanner`, `internal/watch`, `internal/api`, `migrations/003_scan_jobs.sql`

**Database**

- Added `scan_jobs` table for scan history: status, scope, library ID, trigger source, timestamps, error text, and prune counters (`files_seen`, `files_pruned`, `items_pruned`).
- Existing `libraries` table remains the source of truth for filesystem roots. Env paths sync into it on startup; API-created libraries use the same deterministic IDs as the scanner (`scanner.LibraryID`).

**`internal/libraries`**

- `SyncConfigured` upserts env libraries without deleting API-managed rows.
- Full CRUD for filesystem libraries (`music` and `shelf` + `book`/`podcast`). Remote `samo://` libraries are read-only through this API.
- `ScanAll` / `ScanLibrary` run under a process-wide mutex, call `scanner.ScanWithStats`, persist a `scan_jobs` row, and return the final job record.
- `ScannerLibraries` lists DB-backed roots for the watcher (skips `samo://` paths).

**`internal/scanner`**

- Per-library scan accumulates seen file paths, shelf item IDs, and podcast episode IDs.
- After each library scan: prune missing `media_files`, shelf items, and local podcast episodes; then prune orphan music tracks/albums/artists.
- `ScanWithStats` returns aggregate counters for job recording. `Scan` delegates to it.

**`internal/watch`**

- Reloads libraries from SQLite before each debounced rescan (no longer tied to startup env snapshot only).

**HTTP API**

- `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/libraries`
- `POST /api/v1/libraries/{id}/scan`, `POST /api/v1/scan`
- `GET /api/v1/scan/jobs`, `GET /api/v1/scan/jobs/{id}`
- Scan routes refresh the in-memory catalog after success.

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- Watcher-triggered scans did not yet write `scan_jobs` rows (addressed in the next foundation pass).
- Library path moves that change deterministic IDs need an explicit migration path (addressed in the next foundation pass).
- Playback writes and catalog media streaming were not yet split into dedicated packages (addressed in the next foundation pass below).

### 2026-05-22 — Playback persistence, media streaming, and library hardening

**Packages:** `internal/playback`, `internal/files`, `internal/libraries`, `internal/watch`, `internal/api`

**`internal/playback`**

- Owns all writes to `playback_json` (music artists/albums/tracks/playlists) and `progress_json` (shelf items, podcast episodes).
- Target kinds: `music-artist`, `music-album`, `music-track`, `music-playlist`, `shelf-item`, `shelf-episode`.
- `GET` returns normalized state; `PUT` replaces; `PATCH` merges partial updates with optional play/skip increments and timestamp touches.
- Validates entity existence, rating range (0–5), and non-negative counters before writing.

**`internal/files`**

- Resolves `media_files` rows and serves bytes with `http.ServeContent` (Range requests supported).
- Validates every local path against configured filesystem library roots; rejects paths outside libraries and `samo://` virtual roots.
- Used by track/item/episode stream shortcuts and album/item cover routes.

**`internal/libraries` (hardening)**

- `PATCH` may relocate a library path: inserts the new deterministic ID, moves `library_id` on child rows, deletes the old row.
- `ScanFilesystem` records watcher scans in `scan_jobs` with `trigger_source = filesystem`.

**`internal/watch` (hardening)**

- Uses a `Scan` callback (typically `libraries.ScanFilesystem`) so filesystem rescans share the same mutex, prune logic, and job history as API scans.
- Reloads library roots from SQLite before each debounced rescan.

**HTTP API**

- `GET|PUT|PATCH /api/v1/playback/{kind}/{id}`
- `GET /api/v1/media/files/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/media/files/{id}/stream`
- `GET /api/v1/music/tracks/{id}/stream`, `GET /api/v1/music/albums/{id}/cover`
- `GET /api/v1/shelf/items/{id}/stream`, `GET /api/v1/shelf/items/{id}/cover`, `GET /api/v1/shelf/episodes/{id}/stream`
- Playback and scan routes refresh the in-memory catalog after successful writes.

### 2026-05-22 — Embedded cover extraction and multi-file streaming

**Packages:** `internal/covers`, `internal/scanner`, `internal/files`, `internal/api`, `migrations/004_extracted_covers.sql`

**Database**

- Added `extracted_covers` table mapping stable cover IDs to on-disk cache paths, source audio paths, and source checksums for re-extract decisions.

**`internal/covers`**

- Extracts embedded artwork with `ffmpeg` when sidecar images are absent.
- Caches under `{SAMO_DATA_DIR}/covers/{cover_id}.jpg`.
- Skips re-extraction when the source audio checksum is unchanged and the cache file still exists.
- Detects attached pictures with `ffprobe` before invoking `ffmpeg`.

**`internal/scanner`**

- Computes per-file checksums from path, size, and mtime during probe.
- Resolves covers in priority order: sidecar image in folder, then embedded extraction.
- `Scanner` accepts `Options{Covers}` via `NewWithOptions`.

**`internal/files`**

- Allows serving from the cover cache directory in addition to library roots.

**HTTP API**

- `GET /api/v1/media/covers/{id}` (metadata) and `GET /api/v1/media/covers/{id}/image`
- Track/item/episode stream shortcuts are disc- and progress-aware; `?mediaFileId=` still forces a specific file

### 2026-05-22 — Podcast feed polling and refresh scheduling

**Packages:** `internal/sources`, `internal/config`, `internal/api`, `cmd/samo-server`, `migrations/005_podcast_poll.sql`

**Database**

- Added poll columns on `podcast_feeds`: `poll_enabled`, `poll_interval_seconds`, `next_poll_at`, `last_poll_started_at`, `last_poll_finished_at`, `consecutive_errors`.
- Index on `(poll_enabled, next_poll_at)` for due-feed queries.

**`internal/sources`**

- Each feed carries a `Poll` schedule (enabled flag, interval, next run, last start/finish, consecutive errors).
- `UpdatePodcastFeed` patches title and poll settings without re-fetching RSS.
- `ListDuePodcastFeeds` / `RunPodcastPollCycle` refresh feeds whose `next_poll_at` is due.
- Manual `RefreshPodcastFeed` and scheduled polls share the same path: mark start, fetch/save RSS, mark success with interval-based `next_poll_at`, or mark failure with capped exponential backoff (15m floor, 6h ceiling).
- `savePodcastFeed` upserts feed metadata on refresh without overwriting user poll settings.
- `Poller` runs on a ticker (`SAMO_PODCAST_POLL_TICK`, default 1m) and reloads the in-memory catalog after successful updates.

**HTTP API**

- `PATCH /api/v1/shelf/podcast-feeds/{id}` — update title, `pollEnabled`, `pollIntervalSeconds` (900s–7d).
- `POST /api/v1/shelf/podcast-feeds/poll` — run one poll cycle immediately (admin-style trigger).

**Config**

- `SAMO_PODCAST_POLL` (default `true`) — start background poller.
- `SAMO_PODCAST_POLL_TICK` (default `1m`) — scheduler tick interval.

### 2026-05-22 — Metadata override layer (phase 2)

**Packages:** `internal/catalog`, `internal/scanner`, `internal/sources`, `internal/metadata`, `internal/api`

**Write-time guarding**

- `OverrideIndex` loads override patches once per scan or RSS save.
- Scanner upserts skip SQL columns and junction-table sync for overridden apply fields.
- RSS `savePodcastFeed` guards feed and episode metadata before opening write transactions (avoids SQLite lock contention).
- `PruneStaleMetadataOverrides` removes override rows for deleted catalog entities after scans.

**Admin API**

- `GET /api/v1/metadata/overrides/{targetKind}/{targetId}` — inspect stored override fields.
- `DELETE /api/v1/metadata/overrides/{targetKind}/{targetId}` — remove all overrides for a target.
- `PATCH /api/v1/metadata/overrides/{targetKind}/{targetId}` — clear specific override fields (`fields` list).

**Podcast feed reads**

- `GetPodcastFeed` / `ListPodcastFeeds` project `podcast-feed` overrides onto API responses.

**Tests**

- Scanner preserves overridden artist columns in SQLite while catalog projection shows user values.
- RSS refresh preserves overridden feed title in SQLite while API reads show user values.
- Override admin get/clear/delete lifecycle.

### 2026-05-22 — Bit-perfect direct playback hardening

**Packages:** `internal/files`, `internal/api`

**`internal/files`**

- Default stream path still serves original on-disk bytes via `http.ServeContent` (Range requests, no transcoding).
- Resume offsets (`ServeMediaFileAt` / `X-Samo-Stream-Offset-Seconds`) now copy from the computed byte offset with an explicit `Content-Length` for the tail, because `http.ServeContent` resets seek position to zero.
- Symlink escape and library-root validation tests cover path safety.

**HTTP API**

- Track, shelf item, and episode stream shortcuts unchanged; shelf resume now returns the correct tail bytes end-to-end.

**Tests**

- Full GET and ranged responses match source file bytes (`internal/files`, `internal/api`).
- Resume offset serves unmodified tail bytes after a computed byte seek.
- Shelf multi-file stream selects the progress-aware file and resumes within that file.

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- No transcoded alternate route yet.
- Subsonic stream compatibility relies on the same files service; dedicated Subsonic byte-equality tests are optional follow-up.

### 2026-05-22 — Music browse views and playlist CRUD

**Packages:** `internal/catalog`, `internal/playlists`, `internal/playback`, `internal/api`

**`internal/catalog`**

- `MusicBrowse` builds favorites, starred, recently-played, and recently-added views from the in-memory catalog with per-user playback overlay (favorite, starred, `lastPlayedAt`, `createdAt`).

**`internal/playlists`**

- `Create` / `Update` / `Delete` for `music_playlists` rows with owner checks, track ID validation, and duration aggregation.
- Playlist metadata apply uses `music-playlist` override kind; stale override rows prune when playlists are deleted.

**`internal/playback`**

- `ListForUser` loads all playback rows for a target kind (used by browse handlers).

**HTTP API**

- `GET /api/v1/music/browse/favorites|starred|recently-played|recently-added` — paginated browse payloads with user playback overlay.
- `POST /api/v1/music/playlists`, `PATCH /api/v1/music/playlists/{id}`, `DELETE /api/v1/music/playlists/{id}` — owner-scoped mutations; catalog reload after success.

**Tests**

- Browse filtering/sorting with playback overlay (`internal/catalog`).
- Playlist create/update/delete and owner enforcement (`internal/playlists`).

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- Public playlist read filtering (non-owner access rules) not expanded yet.
- List/detail music routes outside browse still return catalog-global playback JSON unless a dedicated overlay pass is added later.

### 2026-05-22 — Search and filter index (phase 1)

**Packages:** `internal/search`, `internal/api`, `internal/subsonic`

**`internal/search`**

- Owns catalog search indexes rebuilt from `catalog.Seed` on startup and catalog reload.
- Multi-token text matching (all terms must match) with relevance scoring.
- Structured filters: `genre`, `year`, `libraryId`, `favorite`, `starred`, `recentlyPlayed`, `recentlyAdded`, `completed`, `minRating`, `mediaType` (shelf).
- Sort modes: `relevance` (default), `title`, `added`, `played`.
- Per-user playback overlay for filter/sort fields that depend on user state.

**HTTP API**

- `GET /api/v1/music/search` and `GET /api/v1/shelf/search` accept the filter/sort query params above in addition to `q`.
- Subsonic `search2` / `search3` use the same music text index via `SearchMusicText`.

**Tests**

- Token matching, genre/favorite filters, sort-by-played, narrator/series shelf search (`internal/search`).

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- In-memory index only (no SQLite FTS5 or external search engine yet).
- Filter-only searches with empty `q` are supported but not exposed as browse shortcuts.

### 2026-05-22 — Remote podcast enclosure streaming (phase 1–2)

**Packages:** `internal/podcaststream`, `internal/podcastcache`, `internal/files`, `internal/sources`, `internal/api`, `migrations/011_podcast_episode_cache.sql`

**`internal/podcaststream`**

- Proxies RSS episode enclosure URLs when an episode has no local `media_files` rows.
- Forwards client `Range` requests; applies resume offsets from saved episode progress via upstream `Range: bytes=N-`.
- Rejects loopback/private hosts by default (SSRF guard).
- `FetchEnclosure` supports cache downloads with a per-file byte cap.

**`internal/podcastcache`**

- Downloads enclosures into `{SAMO_DATA_DIR}/podcast-cache/` and records rows in `podcast_episode_cache`.
- Stream path prefers cached on-disk bytes (`X-Samo-Stream-Source: cache`) before proxying (`enclosure`).
- Background download after a cache miss while streaming.
- Retention: max total bytes, max age since last access, stale enclosure URL cleanup, and orphan row cleanup after RSS saves.

**Config**

- `SAMO_PODCAST_CACHE` (default `true`)
- `SAMO_PODCAST_CACHE_MAX_BYTES` (default `10GiB`)
- `SAMO_PODCAST_CACHE_MAX_AGE` (default `720h`)
- `SAMO_PODCAST_CACHE_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (default `500MiB`)

**HTTP API**

- `GET /api/v1/shelf/episodes/{id}/stream` uses local files when present, otherwise cache, otherwise enclosure proxy.

**Tests**

- Upstream proxy with resume offset and client Range forwarding (`internal/podcaststream`).
- Cache download, retention pruning, and cached stream bytes (`internal/podcastcache`, `internal/api`).

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- No explicit admin prefetch/evict API yet.
- Cached bytes are stored as downloaded from publishers, not re-validated with checksums beyond enclosure URL matching.

### 2026-05-22 — Metadata override layer (phase 1)

**Packages:** `internal/catalog`, `internal/metadata`, `migrations/010_metadata_overrides.sql`

**Database**

- Added `metadata_overrides` table storing user-applied field patches keyed by `(target_kind, target_id)`.

**`internal/metadata`**

- Metadata apply now writes override patches instead of mutating catalog SQLite rows directly.
- Preview/merge behavior is unchanged; apply persists field-level patches for all supported targets.

**`internal/catalog`**

- `LoadSeedFromDB` loads overrides and projects them onto hydrated music/shelf entities before returning the seed.
- Podcast feed apply overrides project onto the linked shelf podcast item via `podcast_feeds.podcast_id`.
- Rescans and RSS refreshes may still rewrite source catalog rows, but client-facing catalog projections keep user overrides.

**Tests**

- Apply stores overrides and survives simulated rescan/RSS clobber during catalog reload.

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- None for the metadata override foundation; phase 1 and phase 2 are complete for this layer.

### 2026-05-22 — Metadata candidate preview and apply

**Packages:** `internal/metadata`, `internal/api`, `cmd/samo-server`

**`internal/metadata`**

- `MetadataApplyService` writes user-selected fields from `SearchResult` candidates into `metadata_overrides` patches (projected at catalog load time).
- `POST /api/v1/metadata/apply/preview` returns `before`, merged `after`, `allowedFields`, `appliedFields`, and `skippedFields` without writing.
- `POST /api/v1/metadata/apply` requires a non-empty `fields` list (confirmation gate), merges `externalIds`, updates contributors/series relations for shelf items, and reloads the in-memory catalog.
- Targets: `shelf-item`, `shelf-episode`, `music-artist`, `music-album`, `music-track`, `podcast-feed`.
- Apply routes are admin-only because they mutate shared catalog metadata. Search/provider routes are authenticated user routes and do not write.
- Podcast feed apply writes both the `podcast_feeds` source row and the corresponding `shelf_items.podcast_json` projection in one transaction, so clients reading `/api/v1/shelf/podcasts` see applied metadata immediately after catalog reload.

### 2026-05-22 — Disc-aware default stream selection

**Packages:** `internal/catalog`, `internal/files`, `internal/api`

**`internal/catalog`**

- `SortAudioFiles` orders linked files by disc/track embedded tags, then path.
- `SelectStreamTarget` resolves the stream file from `mediaFileId`, `disc`, or saved playback progress across multi-file shelf items and episodes.
- Hydrated catalog audio file lists use the same sort order clients see in stream responses.

**`internal/files`**

- `ServeMediaFileAt` seeks to an approximate byte offset for resume positions and sets `X-Samo-Stream-Offset-Seconds`.

**HTTP API**

- Track/item/episode stream shortcuts set `X-Samo-Media-File-Id` and optional global/offset headers.
- Music track streams default `disc` to the track's own `discNumber` when multiple files exist.

### 2026-05-22 — Scanner metadata expansion

**Packages:** `internal/scanner`, `internal/watch`

**`internal/scanner`**

- Centralized tag alias resolution (`tags.go`) for ID3, MP4, Vorbis, and iTunes field names (artist, album artist, dates, disc/track numbers, barcodes, podcast fields, series, etc.).
- `mergeProbeTags` combines embedded tags across all files in an audiobook or podcast folder so multi-part releases keep the richest metadata.
- Improved explicit detection via iTunes advisory values (`1` explicit, `2` clean) in addition to boolean tags.
- Audiobook sidecars: `metadata.json` (Audiobookshelf-style), existing `desc.txt` / `reader.txt` / `.opf`, plus `.cue` chapter sheets when embedded chapters are absent.
- Music sidecars: Kodi-style `album.nfo` for album title, artists, year, genre, label, and UPC.
- Music artists now persist `sortName` from `artistsort` / `albumartistsort` tags when present.
- Shelf items store top-level `tags` from embedded tag fields; audiobook items populate `book.tags` consistently.
- Expanded published-date parsing (RFC3339, common locale formats, year-only fallback).

**`internal/watch`**

- Filesystem watcher retriggers scans for `metadata.json`, `.cue`, and `.nfo` sidecar changes.

### 2026-05-22 — Admin boundaries and local file containment

**Packages:** `internal/api`, `internal/files`

**`internal/api`**

- `requireUser` authenticates every `/api/v1/*` route into a `users.Principal`.
- `requireAdmin` centralizes role checks for shared-server management actions.
- Admin-only routes include user list/create, filesystem library management, scan orchestration/job history, podcast feed source mutations, internet-radio source mutations, and metadata apply/preview.
- Normal users continue to read catalog/search/playback surfaces through the Samo-native API.

**`internal/files`**

- Local media serving now checks both the requested path and its symlink-resolved target against configured library roots and allowed cache roots.
- Configured roots keep both their declared absolute path and their resolved path, so symlinked library roots still work while symlink escapes inside a library are rejected.
- Outside-library paths are rejected before file existence is revealed.

## Startup Flow

`cmd/samo-server/main.go` owns process assembly only. Keep it thin.

Startup currently does this:

1. Load env config with `config.LoadEnv`.
2. Open SQLite with `storage.Open`.
3. Apply embedded migrations with `storage.ApplyMigrations`.
4. Create `covers.Service` (cache dir under `{SAMO_DATA_DIR}/covers`).
5. Create `scanner.Scanner` with the covers service wired in, then `libraries.Service`.
6. Sync env-configured libraries into SQLite with `libraries.Service.SyncConfigured`.
7. If configured, scan libraries on startup with `libraries.Service.ScanAll`.
8. Hydrate catalog seed data from SQLite with `catalog.LoadSeedFromDB`.
9. Load optional radio JSON config with `radio.LoadConfigFile`.
10. Create `catalog.Service`, `playback.Service`, `files.Service`, `metadata.Service`, `radio.Service`, and `sources.Service`.
11. Build `api.Server`.
12. If configured, start the podcast feed poller (reloads catalog after successful poll cycles).
13. If configured, start the library watcher (reloads libraries from SQLite, records filesystem scan jobs).
14. Start `http.ListenAndServe`.

This means HTTP handlers do not talk directly to scanner code or raw startup config. They receive services.

## Configuration

Main environment variables:

- `SAMO_ADDR`: listen address, defaults to `:4500`
- `SAMO_DATA_DIR`: data directory, defaults to `data`
- `SAMO_DB_PATH`: SQLite database path, defaults to `data/samo.db`
- `SAMO_RADIO_CONFIG`: radio JSON config, defaults to `data/radio.json`
- `SAMO_API_TOKEN`: optional bearer token for `/api/v1/*`
- `SAMO_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME`: optional first admin username, defaults to `admin`
- `SAMO_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`: optional first admin password. If omitted on first run, startup generates and logs a random one-time password; if the named admin already exists, setting this env var updates that admin's password.
- `SAMO_SCAN_ON_START`: defaults to `true`
- `SAMO_WATCH_LIBRARIES`: defaults to `true`
- `SAMO_WATCH_DEBOUNCE`: filesystem change debounce duration, defaults to `3s`
- `SAMO_METADATA_PROVIDERS`: comma-separated external lookup providers, defaults to empty/off
- `SAMO_METADATA_USER_AGENT`: user-agent for external metadata requests, used by MusicBrainz
- `SAMO_MUSIC_DIRS`: path-list of music library folders
- `SAMO_AUDIOBOOK_DIRS`: path-list of audiobook library folders
- `SAMO_PODCAST_DIRS`: path-list of podcast library folders
- `SAMO_PODCAST_POLL`: enable background RSS polling, defaults to `true`
- `SAMO_PODCAST_POLL_TICK`: poll scheduler tick interval, defaults to `1m`

Embedded cover art is cached under `{SAMO_DATA_DIR}/covers`. Static `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` ship in `bin/` beside the server binary on Ubuntu (see `internal/toolchain` and [docs/install-ubuntu.md](docs/install-ubuntu.md)).

Path-list values use the OS separator, so Linux/macOS use `:`.

## Package Responsibilities

### `cmd/samo-server`

Process composition only. It should not contain business logic, SQL details, scanner parsing, route behavior, or metadata mapping.

### `internal/config`

Loads and validates process-level settings from env vars. Feature-specific config belongs near the owning module when it grows beyond simple env fields.

### `internal/toolchain`

Resolves bundled `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` for Ubuntu/Linux deployments.

Lookup order:

1. `SAMO_FFMPEG_PATH` / `SAMO_FFPROBE_PATH` overrides
2. `{executable_dir}/bin/ffmpeg` and `bin/ffprobe` (release tarball layout)
3. `{SAMO_DATA_DIR}/tools/linux-gpl-latest/{linux-amd64|linux-arm64}/` cached extract
4. repository `bin/` during local development
5. embedded assets when built with `-tags bundled`

Samo does not search the system `PATH` for ffmpeg. Ubuntu servers should use the bundled `bin/` layout from [docs/install-ubuntu.md](docs/install-ubuntu.md).

### `internal/storage`

Owns SQLite connection setup and migration application.

Responsibilities:

- create database parent directory
- open `sqlite3`
- apply pragmas
- run migrations idempotently

It should not know about music, audiobooks, radio, or HTTP.

### `migrations`

Embeds ordered `.sql` migrations. Migration names are the migration versions.

Current schema stores:

- libraries
- scan jobs (library scan history and prune counters)
- media files
- music artists, albums, tracks, playlists, genres
- music artist/album/track relationships
- shelf libraries/items/authors/series/chapters
- podcast episodes
- remote podcast feed source records
- internet radio station source records
- JSON columns for rich metadata that is still evolving

Use migrations for schema evolution. Do not silently mutate schema in Go code.

### `internal/catalog`

Defines Samo-native catalog domain/API DTOs and read behavior.

Important files:

- `types.go`: shared metadata structs like images, external IDs, audio files, chapters, playback state
- `music_types.go`: artists, albums, tracks, playlists, music search
- `shelf_types.go`: libraries, audiobook/podcast items, authors, series, podcast episodes
- `service.go`: in-memory read service used by API handlers
- `sqlite.go`: hydrates a `catalog.Seed` from SQLite

The catalog service is read-optimized and guarded by a mutex. It can be refreshed with `Replace(seed)` after scans. Handlers continue to read through the service rather than querying raw SQL.

### `internal/metadata`

Owns optional external metadata lookup providers. This package is for explicit user-initiated search only, like a future web UI asking "find metadata for this book/show/album." It must not run automatically during scanner walks, watcher events, source ingestion, or startup.

Current providers:

- `openlibrary`: audiobook/book metadata through Open Library search
- `googlebooks`: audiobook/book metadata through Google Books volume search
- `itunes`: podcast directory metadata through Apple's iTunes Search API
- `musicbrainz`: music artist, album/release-group, and track/recording metadata through MusicBrainz search

Providers are disabled by default. `cmd/samo-server` only registers providers named in `SAMO_METADATA_PROVIDERS`. An empty provider list means `/api/v1/metadata/search` returns no results and performs no outbound network calls.

Responsibilities:

- define common metadata search request/result DTOs
- normalize provider configuration
- route explicit searches to enabled providers
- map provider-specific JSON into Samo metadata candidates
- preserve provider IDs and URLs in `catalog.ExternalIDs`/links

It writes user-confirmed fields to `metadata_overrides` via `MetadataApplyService`; catalog projection merges overrides at load time. It must not call external providers automatically during scans or ingestion.

### `internal/libraries`

Owns filesystem library records, scan orchestration, and scan job history.

Responsibilities:

- sync env-configured library paths into SQLite on startup
- list/create/update/delete filesystem libraries over the API
- trigger full or per-library scans
- record scan job status, timing, and prune counts
- expose the current scanner library list for the filesystem watcher

It should not parse tags, call `ffprobe`, or handle HTTP directly.

### `internal/covers`

Owns embedded artwork extraction and the on-disk cover cache.

Responsibilities:

- detect attached pictures in audio files
- extract artwork into `{dataDir}/covers`
- persist `extracted_covers` rows with source checksums
- serve stable cover IDs to catalog image metadata

It should not scan full libraries or handle HTTP directly.

### `internal/playback`

Owns listening-state writes for catalog entities stored as JSON in SQLite.

Responsibilities:

- read and write `playback_json` / `progress_json` columns
- validate target kind and ID existence
- normalize and validate playback payloads (rating, counts, progress)
- support explicit PUT replacement and PATCH merges

It should not hydrate the catalog read model directly; callers refresh `catalog.Service` after writes.

### `internal/files`

Owns safe access to on-disk media referenced by the catalog.

Responsibilities:

- load `media_files` metadata by ID
- verify local paths stay inside configured filesystem library roots
- stream audio/image bytes with range support and content types from DB metadata

It should not scan libraries, parse tags, or own playback state.

### `internal/scanner`

Walks configured libraries, calls `ffprobe`, maps discovered metadata into SQLite.

Current scanner behavior:

- accepts common audio extensions
- skips hidden directories
- uses deterministic SHA-256 based IDs
- uses `ffprobe` for container, stream, tag, chapter, and duration metadata
- creates music artists/albums/tracks from tags
- groups audiobooks by folder
- groups podcasts by first folder under the podcast library
- writes technical audio file metadata
- tracks detected embedded metadata formats such as ID3, MP4, and Vorbis comments
- writes embedded tags as JSON
- writes audiobook chapters from embedded chapter data or file-part fallback chapters
- prunes stale media files, shelf items, and local podcast episodes after each library scan
- removes orphaned music tracks, albums, and artists after pruning
- reads OverDrive MediaMarkers into audiobook chapters when available
- reads audiobook sidecars: `desc.txt`, `reader.txt`, and `.opf`
- discovers local cover images such as `cover.jpg`, `folder.png`, `front.webp`, or `album.jpg`
- extracts embedded cover art into the cover cache when sidecars are missing
- resolves tag aliases across ID3/MP4/Vorbis/iTunes field names
- merges embedded tags across multi-file audiobook and podcast folders
- reads audiobook `metadata.json`, `.opf`, text sidecars, and `.cue` chapter sheets
- reads music `album.nfo` sidecars for album-level metadata and UPC

The scanner writes to SQLite. It should not return API response DTOs directly to HTTP.

### `internal/watch`

Owns filesystem watching and scan orchestration.

Responsibilities:

- recursively watch configured library roots
- add watches for newly-created directories
- filter events to audio, sidecar metadata, and cover image paths
- debounce bursts of writes
- reload library roots from SQLite before each rescan
- call the shared library scan callback (records `scan_jobs`, prunes stale rows)
- run scanner after changes settle
- reload catalog seed data from SQLite
- call `catalog.Service.Replace` so API handlers see new data

It should not parse metadata, write SQL directly, or handle HTTP.

### `internal/sources`

Owns user-added remote sources. This package is the first "coagulator" layer: it pulls remote inputs into Samo-owned catalog data without making handlers or scanners know remote feed details.

Current responsibilities:

- validate and fetch podcast RSS feed URLs
- parse RSS and iTunes podcast metadata
- upsert remote podcast feeds as shelf podcast items and podcast episodes
- store podcast feed source state, fetch timestamps, errors, and poll schedule
- poll due RSS feeds on a background ticker with backoff on failure
- store user-added internet radio station URLs
- expose source read/write methods for API handlers

Podcast feeds are unique because a podcast can come from local files through `internal/scanner` or from RSS through `internal/sources`. Both paths write into the same shelf podcast and episode tables so clients can use one podcast API shape.

Internet radio stations are simpler source records: Samo stores the stream URL and descriptive metadata, then exposes public playlist/redirect links. They do not create shelf items and they do not participate in the 24/7 scheduler yet.

`internal/sources` may write SQL because it owns these source ingestion workflows. It should not handle HTTP and should not become a general catalog query service.

### `internal/api`

Owns HTTP routing and response writing.

Current namespaces:

- `/api/v1/libraries/*`
- `/api/v1/scan/*`
- `/api/v1/playback/*`
- `/api/v1/media/*`
- `/api/v1/catalog/*`
- `/api/v1/metadata/*`
- `/api/v1/music/*`
- `/api/v1/shelf/*`
- `/api/v1/radio/*`
- `/api/v1/internet-radio/*`
- public `/radio/{id}/playlist.m3u`
- public `/radio/{id}/stream`
- public `/internet-radio/{id}/playlist.m3u`
- public `/internet-radio/{id}/stream`

API handlers should stay thin:

- parse path/query/body
- call services
- map errors to HTTP responses
- write JSON or stream output

Do not put SQL, scanning, tag parsing, or long-running workflow logic in handlers.

### `internal/radio`

Owns the first radio module:

- loads optional JSON station config
- normalizes stations and media items
- calculates deterministic current/upcoming slots
- exposes stream behavior from scheduled local files

The current stream is first-generation: it seeks approximately by duration and throttles file bytes to approximate real-time playback. It assumes compatible source files per station.

### `internal/media`

Shared media taxonomy used across radio/catalog/scanner. Keep broad media kind definitions here when they are shared by multiple modules.

## API Direction

Samo's primary API is native and metadata-rich. Compatibility layers can come later.

The native API is documented in `docs/api.md`.

Current music surface:

- artists
- albums
- tracks
- genres
- playlists
- search

Current shelf surface:

- libraries
- items
- audiobooks
- authors
- series
- podcasts
- episodes
- search

Current radio surface:

- stations
- station detail
- now playing
- schedule
- playlist
- stream

Current source-ingestion surface:

- podcast feed list/create/detail/refresh/delete
- internet radio station list/create/detail/delete
- public M3U and stream redirect routes for internet radio stations

Current library management surface:

- filesystem library list/create/update/delete
- manual full-library and per-library scan triggers
- scan job list/detail with prune counts

Current playback surface:

- get, replace, and patch playback/progress state for music and shelf entities
- optional play/skip increments and last-played timestamps on patch

Current media surface:

- media file metadata by ID
- byte streaming for media files, tracks, shelf items, and podcast episodes
- cover image streaming for music albums and shelf items with local cover paths

Current metadata lookup surface:

- enabled metadata provider list
- explicit metadata search for audiobooks, podcasts, and music
- metadata apply preview/apply with field-level confirmation

The API should preserve rich metadata rather than flattening to the lowest common denominator. Navidrome/OpenSubsonic and Audiobookshelf compatibility should map into or out of Samo-native models.

## Metadata Philosophy

Samo clients are expected to use rich metadata. Capture and preserve more than the first UI needs.

Important metadata categories:

- canonical IDs and provider IDs
- sort titles and sort names
- display artist strings alongside structured artist arrays
- music technical metadata
- music release version, compilation flag, label, catalog number, barcode, MusicBrainz/Discogs/Spotify/Apple/ISRC IDs
- audiobook narrators, authors, series, ISBN/ASIN/provider IDs
- audiobook sidecars and OverDrive MediaMarkers
- podcast feed, owner, episode, enclosure, and GUID data
- embedded tags
- chapters
- cover/image metadata
- playback/progress/rating/favorite state

When unsure whether a field matters, prefer storing it in a structured place or in embedded tags rather than discarding it.

## Architecture Rules

Avoid god components. Keep ownership boundaries clear.

Rules:

- `cmd` wires dependencies; it does not implement behavior.
- `api` handles HTTP only.
- `catalog` defines read models and catalog query behavior.
- `playback` owns listening-state writes.
- `files` owns validated local media byte serving.
- `metadata` searches external metadata providers and applies user-confirmed candidate fields when explicitly called.
- `libraries` owns library records and scan orchestration.
- `covers` owns embedded artwork extraction and cache rows.
- `scanner` discovers and writes metadata.
- `watch` observes filesystem changes and coordinates scanner/catalog refresh.
- `sources` ingests remote RSS and stream URL records.
- `storage` owns DB setup/migration mechanics.
- `radio` owns radio scheduling/streaming behavior.
- shared types only move to shared packages after multiple modules need them.
- avoid cross-package cycles.
- prefer interfaces only when they remove real coupling or unlock tests.
- keep SQL out of HTTP handlers.
- keep ffprobe/tag parsing out of HTTP handlers and catalog read service.
- add migrations for schema changes.
- add focused tests around package boundaries.

## Current Known Limits

These are expected first-pass limits, not accidental bugs:

- scanner does not fetch remote metadata; remote RSS ingestion lives in `internal/sources`
- external metadata lookup still does not download remote cover art into the local cache automatically
- scanner does not download remote cover art (only sidecars + embedded extraction)
- scanner does not transcode audio
- relocating a library path assigns a new deterministic library ID; clients must follow the ID returned by `PATCH`
- stream shortcuts accept `?mediaFileId=` to force a specific linked file; otherwise selection is disc- and progress-aware
- radio config is still JSON-backed rather than catalog-backed
- internet radio stations are stored and shared, but not probed for live metadata yet
- podcast feed deletion removes the remote podcast shelf item; it does not reconcile with a local-file podcast of the same show yet
- native API uses per-user bearer tokens; legacy `SAMO_API_TOKEN` maps to bootstrap user `user-server`
- Subsonic adapter maps Samo music IDs directly; per-library album filtering in `getAlbumList2` is not wired yet

### 2026-05-22 — Subsonic / OpenSubsonic compatibility

**Packages:** `internal/subsonic`, `internal/catalog`, `internal/api`

**`internal/subsonic`**

- JSON Subsonic API under `/rest/{action}` and `/rest/{action}.view`.
- Maps Samo music libraries, artists, albums, tracks, playlists, search, stream, and cover art onto existing catalog and files services.
- Auth reuses `SAMO_API_TOKEN` via Subsonic password (`p=`), token auth (`t`/`s`), or Bearer header. Open when no token is configured.

**`internal/catalog`**

- Added relation helpers: albums for artist, tracks for album/playlist, cover art ID resolution.

**HTTP**

- Registered `/rest/*` routes alongside existing Samo-native API (not behind `requireAPIAuth`; Subsonic auth is separate).

**Intentional v1 limits**

- JSON only (`f=json`); XML not implemented yet.
- No user accounts, starred/frequent album lists, or Subsonic XML yet.
- `musicFolderId` filtering not applied because albums are not library-scoped in the catalog read model yet.

### 2026-05-22 — Last.fm native scrobbling

**Packages:** `internal/lastfm`, `internal/api`, `internal/config`, `migrations/006_lastfm.sql`

**`internal/lastfm`**

- Last.fm web auth flow with session stored in SQLite.
- Automatic scrobbling from playback `PATCH`/`PUT`, music/subsonic stream starts, and explicit scrobble events.
- Subsonic `scrobble` and `updateNowPlaying` compatibility routes.
- Love/unlove sync when tracks are favorited or starred.
- Failed submissions queued with audit history; background poller retries; invalid sessions auto-cleared.

**HTTP**

- `GET /api/v1/lastfm/status`, queue, history
- `POST /api/v1/lastfm/auth/begin`, `POST /api/v1/lastfm/auth/complete`
- `DELETE /api/v1/lastfm/auth/session`
- `POST /api/v1/lastfm/queue/flush`
- `POST /api/v1/scrobble/events`
- Subsonic `GET /rest/scrobble`, `GET /rest/updateNowPlaying`

**Config**

- `SAMO_LASTFM_API_KEY`, `SAMO_LASTFM_SHARED_SECRET`
- `SAMO_LASTFM_POLL`, `SAMO_LASTFM_POLL_TICK`

**Intentional limits**

- one linked Last.fm account per Samo user
- scrobbling is music-track only (not shelf/radio)
- listen timing uses client-reported progress or stream resume position

### 2026-05-22 — Multi-user accounts and per-user Last.fm

**Packages:** `internal/users`, `internal/api`, `internal/playback`, `internal/lastfm`, `internal/subsonic`, `migrations/008_users.sql`, `migrations/009_lastfm_per_user.sql`

**`internal/users`**

- SQLite users with bcrypt passwords and revocable API tokens.
- Bootstrap row `user-server` for legacy `SAMO_API_TOKEN` and migrated Last.fm session data.
- Optional first admin via `SAMO_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME` / `SAMO_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD`.
- Subsonic auth resolves `u` + password or token auth to a Samo user.

**Data model**

- `user_playback` stores per-user progress/ratings/favorites for catalog targets.
- `lastfm_user_settings` stores one Last.fm session per Samo user; queue and submission audit rows include `user_id`.

**HTTP**

- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/users/*` token and profile routes.
- Last.fm and playback routes use the authenticated user's ID.
- Subsonic stream/scrobble routes scrobble for the authenticated Subsonic user.

### 2026-05-22 — Audiobook bookmarks, collections, listening sessions, author/series items

**Packages:** `internal/shelfuser`, `internal/catalog`, `internal/api`, `migrations/012_shelf_user.sql`

**Database**

- `shelf_bookmarks` — per-user position bookmarks on audiobook `shelf_items` only.
- `shelf_collections` and `shelf_collection_items` — ordered user lists of audiobook items.
- `shelf_listening_sessions` — append-only progress segments recorded from playback updates.

**`internal/shelfuser`**

- Bookmark CRUD scoped to the authenticated user and audiobook items.
- Collection CRUD with owner checks; rejects podcast shelf items.
- `RecordSession` / list-by-item / recent sessions for the user.

**`internal/catalog`**

- `ShelfAuthorDetail` and `ShelfSeriesDetail` embed paginated matching items.
- `ShelfItemsForAuthor` matches book author contributor IDs; `ShelfItemsForSeries` uses series `itemIds`.

**HTTP API**

- `GET/POST /api/v1/shelf/items/{id}/bookmarks`, `PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/shelf/bookmarks/{id}`
- `GET/POST /api/v1/shelf/collections`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/shelf/collections/{id}`
- `GET /api/v1/shelf/items/{id}/sessions`, `GET /api/v1/shelf/listening-sessions`
- `GET /api/v1/shelf/authors/{id}/items`, `GET /api/v1/shelf/series/{id}/items`
- `GET /api/v1/shelf/series` — paginated series list (was missing from handlers).
- Author/series `GET` with `?include=items` returns detail + paginated items in one payload.
- Playback `PUT`/`PATCH` on `shelf-item` records a listening session when progress changes.

**Tests**

- Bookmark/collection/session lifecycle and podcast rejection in collections (`internal/shelfuser`).
- Author/series item pagination (`internal/catalog`).

**Intentional limits left for later foundation passes**

- No Audiobookshelf compatibility routes for bookmarks/collections yet.
- Listening sessions are recorded from API playback writes only (not Subsonic shelf playback).
- Collections are user-private; no shared or admin-managed shelf lists.

## Near-Term Build Path

Useful next steps:

1. Extend Subsonic coverage (starred, XML, per-library indexes).
2. Add Audiobookshelf compatibility routes.
3. Make radio stations optionally source from catalog queries/playlists.
4. ListenBrainz support or shared-household scrobble policies.

## Testing Expectations

Current tests cover:

- API route/token behavior
- rich seeded API response metadata
- catalog filtering/search
- SQLite migration idempotency
- SQLite hydration into catalog seed
- ffprobe result normalization
- audiobook grouping
- external metadata provider mapping
- radio deterministic schedule behavior
- library CRUD and scan job recording
- scanner prune behavior for stale files and orphan music rows
- playback PUT/PATCH validation and persistence
- local path sandboxing and media file range streaming
- library path relocation and filesystem scan job recording
- embedded cover extraction, cache rows, and cover ID serving
- audio file checksum computation and `mediaFileId` stream selection
- podcast feed poll scheduling, due-feed selection, and refresh without clobbering poll settings
- tag alias resolution, multi-file tag merge, cue/metadata.json/nfo sidecars, and iTunes explicit mapping
- disc-aware stream file selection and resume offsets for multi-file shelf items
- metadata apply preview/apply with field-level confirmation, external ID merge, and override persistence
- shelf bookmarks, collections, listening sessions, and author/series item lists

Keep tests focused on contracts and package boundaries. Scanner tests should prefer parser/grouping tests and small generated media fixtures when practical.
